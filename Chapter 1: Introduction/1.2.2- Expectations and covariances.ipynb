If you roll the die a bunch of times and take the average (by summing the values you get and dividing by the number of rolls), the number is going to be close to 3.5. The more rolls you make, the closer the value is likely to be to exactly 3.5. The Law of the Large Numbers says that if you have infinite number of rolls, the actual average comes very very close to 3.5."
